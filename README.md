Welcome, this is my entry for the technical trial offered by Tavernlight Games.

I have answered every question with a commit, so the changes are easy to distinguish. Questions 1 through 4 are presented as individual files at the root of the repository, while questions 5 through 7 consist of changes to the server (TFS folder) and client (OTC) source files. Videos for questions 5 through 7 are also included in their own folder.

The server base code consists of TFS 1.4.0, while the client is Mehah's OTClient 3.1 release. I initially worked with Edubart's latest OTClient, but questions 5 and 6 presented graphical issues that I could not overcome in an acceptable manner without upgrading the client.
