Welcome, this is my entry for the technical trial offered by Tavernlight Games.

I have answered every question with a commit, so the changes are easy to distinguish. Questions 1 through 4 are presented as individual files at the root of the repository, while questions 5 through 7 consist of changes to the server (TFS folder) and client (OTC) source files. Videos for questions 5 through 7 are also included in their own folder.

The server base code consists of TFS 1.4.0, while the client is Mehah's OTClient 3.1 release. I initially worked with Edubart's latest OTClient, but questions 5 and 6 presented graphical issues that I could not overcome in an acceptable manner without upgrading the client.

IMPORTANT: The videos were recorded with the xbox game bar, but due to my screen's DPI and the way the app records them, the captured area looked shrinked while the mouse didn't, making it look like I wasn't really clicking where I was. I've now corrected this issue and added a new set of videos, so it all can be seen more accurately. No changes to the code, just new recordings.
